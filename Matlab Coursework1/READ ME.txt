My submittion requires that the Dataset is unzipped and placed in the working directory with all the scripts placed in the working direction. 
In addition the photo needed for question two needs to be placed in the dataset folder and be called 'name.png'. 

A photo of the file structure need to run the question scripts is included!

Each question is run from its ICV_Q'X'.m file and will output the images and plots into the current working directory which these are to be run from. In addition figures used in the report are printed to the console.

I used fullfile so that my implementation will work on all platforms.





Script Descriptions:

ICV_abs.m

    Returns the appsolute value of a given integer.

ICV_trim.m

    Crops the input image to only the transformed image.

ICV_calc_colour_histogram.m

    Creates a 256x3 array representing the frequencies of each colour given in an image matrix.

ICV_convolve.m

    Performs a convolution using a given square mask of an odd width and an input image.

ICV_find_1NN_colour.m

    Finds the first nearest neight of a given point in a given image. 
    the candidate point must be reverse transformed into find its position in the given image.

ICV_find_det_3x3.m

    Finds the Detminant of a 3x3 matrix

ICV_histogram_intersection.m

    Finds the intersections histogram of two histograms 
    In addition to the normalized percentage intersection fo the two histograms

ICV_horizontal_skew.m

    Performs a skew from the bottom left of the image. Moving the images verticle to x degress from the verticle axis.

ICV_inverse_3x3.m

    Finds the inverse of a 3x3 matrix

ICV_rotate_mask.m

    returns a new mask that is a 180 degree rotation of the input mask

ICV_isMaskSymetric 

    evaluates if the input mask is symetric or not. For the perpose of determined if the mask needs to be rotated to perform convolusion.

ICV_padarry.m

	Takes three inputs: image matrix, mode and thickness. only mode 1 is used. 
    Mode one is pad with zeros. where a padding of zero equal to the thickness is added around the image and the new image returned

ICV_rotate.m

	Takes two inputs a image matrix and a angle. Outputs a rotated image matrix rotated by the angle.

ICV_togrey.m

	Takes an input RGB colour and transforms it into a single gray scale value using the mat lab documentations standard proportions.

ICV_transpose_square.m

	Defines the function that transposes a square matrix.
